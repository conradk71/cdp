Student hours - Spring 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Student hours (some call them "office hours") are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 10:30 AM to 12:30 PM (in person) Monday and Wednesday 2:15 PM to 3:15 PM (online). Walk-ins are welcome but students who `make an appointment <https://calendly.com/leo_irakliotis/15min>`_  take precedence. My office is in **Doyle 207**. I am also available via video conferencing (Zoom and Google Hangouts).
